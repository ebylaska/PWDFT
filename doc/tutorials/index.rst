Getting Started with PWDFT
--------------------------

This section provides step-by-step tutorials for common types of calculations in PWDFT. Each tutorial is designed to be self-contained and includes all necessary input files and expected outputs.

**Tutorial Structure:**

Each tutorial includes:

* **Theory Background**: Brief explanation of the physics involved
* **System Setup**: How to prepare the atomic structure
* **Input Parameters**: Detailed explanation of all keywords
* **Running the Calculation**: Step-by-step execution
* **Analysis**: How to interpret the results
* **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

**Prerequisites:**

* PWDFT installed and tested (see :doc:`../installation/index`)
* Basic understanding of DFT concepts (see :doc:`../theory/index`)
* Familiarity with command-line tools

**Tutorial Progression:**

1. **Water Molecule** - Basic SCF calculation for isolated molecules
2. **Silicon Bulk** - Periodic crystal calculations with k-point sampling
3. **CO on Platinum** - Surface science with adsorbates

**Additional Resources:**

* :doc:`convergence_guide` - How to systematically converge parameters
* :doc:`best_practices` - General guidelines for reliable calculations

**Getting Help:**

If you encounter issues with any tutorial:

* Check the :doc:`../faq/index` section
* Review the :doc:`../api/index` for detailed parameter descriptions
* Ensure your PWDFT installation is working correctly

[*' EMSL Arrows API*'](https://arrows.emsl.pnnl.gov/api)
The difficulty of simulating the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of new materials is convoluted by the sensitivity of the processes at the macroscopic scale to the atomic scale; the unusual and unexpected bonding behaviors of the materials; the complex extreme temperature and pressure environments likely to be encountered; and the requirements that simulations be as parameter free as possible and extremely reliable. The tools of quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics combined with advanced parallel packages such as NWChem have proved to be very effective and productive. Not surprisingly, programs that implement these types of tools make up a large fraction of DOE OS supercomputer cycles. Despite these hugely successful theoretical developments, reliable calculations of this type require considerable computational effort and often the use of codes with difficult input decks.

The NWChem molecular modeling software implements a robust and diverse set of molecular theories that can estimate the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecules and materials. It arguably has the most capabilities of any molecular modeling code today. The problem with NWChem and other molecular modeling codes is that:

Molecular modeling software is extremely complex, contains millions of lines of code, and takes a long time to set up and to learn how to use.
Even the most basic input for molecular modeling software requires the use of other software to generate it.
Because of this complexity people unnaturally identify with codes and molecular theories, and they are hesitant to learn new codes and new molecular simulation techniques.
TinyArrows is a software package that combines NWChem, SQL and NOSQL databases, and web applications that simplifies molecular and materials modeling and makes these modeling capabilities easier to use and more accessible to many scientists and engineers and students. TinyArrows is very simple to use. The user just enters chemical reactions into one, of serveral available web applications, and then results are posted back with thermodynamic, reaction pathway (kinetic), spectroscopy, and other results.

TinyArrows parses the input and then searches the database for the compounds in the reactions. If a compound isn't there, an NWChem calculation is setup and submitted to calculate it. Once the calculation is finished the results are entered into the database and the results are then available to be requested. This whole process is completely automated. To enter different calculation types (e.g. use pspw theory, or pbe0 exchange correlation functional) the SMILES is appended with keyword{options} tags. Examples of inputs are as follows:

C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)O + C  --> C(Cl)(Cl)Cl + CO 
C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)O + C  --> C(Cl)(Cl)Cl + CO ~ theory{pspw}
C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)S + C  --> C(Cl)(Cl)Cl + CS
C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)S + C  --> C(Cl)(Cl)Cl + CS ~ theory{pm3}
TNT + 3 benzene --> toluene + 3 nitrobenzene ~ xc{pbe} 
The results returned by TinyArrows are a combination of text and graphical output, e.g. entering

 TNT + 3 benzene --> toluene + 3 nitrobenzene ~ xc{pbe} 
into TinyArrows produces the following output.

Arrowsoutputimage001b.png

Currently TinyArrows can be used to calculate the following for all NWChem theories:

Reaction thermodynamics for molecular systems
Reaction paths for molecular systems
NMR spectra for molecular and materials systems
Energetics, structures, and band structures of crystals using the Crystal Open Database (COD ) numbers
A variety of datafiles can be returned including XYZ files, CIF files, NWChem output files
We envision that as TinyArrows evolves it will be part of future closed cycles of chemical and materials discovery that requires integrated computational and experimental tools combined with materials synthesis.

Introduction to ESMILES - How to Change Calculation Theories
The combined string, "Molecule_Input keyword1{option1} keyword2{option2} keywordN{optionN}", is called an "extended smiles" or "esmiles" for short. The Molecule_Input can be specified using a variety of formats including a SMILES string, common names, iupac, kegg numbers, cas, pubchem ids, chemspider ids, and InChI strings. The keyword{option} tags are used to enter different calculation types for a molecule, e.g. use pspw theory, ccsd(t), or pbe0 exchange correlation functional.

The following are examples of esmiles strings:

Plane-Wave DFT calculation using LDA and a cutoff energy=30.0 Ry

c1ccccc1 theory{pspw} xc{lda} basis{30.0 Ry}
MP2 calculation using 6-31G* basis set

ESMILES Reactions - How to Calculate Reaction Energies
The basic input is a chemical reaction where the molecules are specified using smiles strings or esmiles strings (vida infra), e.g.

   C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)O + C --> C(Cl)(Cl)Cl + CO
Note that the reaction: :reaction keywords have only one ":", whereas the Arrows keywords use two colons.

The results contain both gas phase and solution phase reaction energies. The default level of theory used in these calculations is b3lyp/6-311++G(2d,2p) and the default solvation model is COSMO. The returned email will contain the following output.

Reaction 1: C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)O + C --> C(Cl)(Cl)Cl + CO    
- instance 1: 1.00 (Id=6833) + 1.00 (Id=11824) --> 1.00 (Id=6832) + 1.00 (Id=11215)

The reaction output for the chemical reaction contains the gas phase reaction energy, gas-phase reaction enthalpy, gas-phase reaction free energy, change in solvation energy, and the solution phase reaction free energy. The energy values are given in kcal/mol, kj/mol, and Hartrees.. Besides the energies the output also provides several rows of information about the calculation:

-       first row: the reaction input parsed  
-       second row: the arrows ids used for the compounds in the reaction  
-       third row: the iupac names of the compounds if available.  If not available the systems will default to using smiles   
                        strings  
-       fourth- rows: the chemical reaction is written using the esmiles notation.  
The esmiles notation contains all the information about the calculations of the compounds. In this example, theory used was dft, basis was 6-311++G(2d,2p), the exchange correlation, the solvation type was cosmo. The charge and multiplicity of the molecules are also given. The value in the nf{} tag contains the number of imaginary frequencies in the vibrational calculation for the molecule.

A variety of other inputs to describe the chemical structure besides smiles can be used, including common names, iupac, kegg numbers, cas, pubchem ids, chemspider ids, and InChI strings. The common names, iupac and InChI strings are entered as replacements to the smiles strings, and the kegg, cas, pubchem, and csid inputs are entered as kegg=value, cas=value, cid=value, csid=value where value is the id. The chemical structure input types can be mixed and matched in the reaction input. The following reaction inputs are all equivalent.

  
trichloromethanol + methane --> chloroform + methyl alcohol
trichloromethanol + C --> chloroform + kegg=D02309
trichloromethanol + C --> chloroform + cas=67-56-1
trichloromethanol + C --> chloroform + cid=887
trichloromethanol + C --> chloroform + csid=864
trichloromethanol + C --> chloroform + InChI=1S/CH4O/c1-2/h2H,1H3
  
To calculate atomization energies the following input can be used.

 C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)O  --> [C]  mult{3} + 3 [Cl] mult{2} + [O] mult{3}
MAP Function for Adding Options to Reactions
To calculate a reaction energy using non-default options the following format could be used, e.g.

Arrows::  
  
reaction:   
trichloromethanol theory{pspw} xc{lda} + methane theory{pspw} xc{lda}   
--> chloroform theory{pspw} xc{lda} + methyl alcohol theory{pspw} xc{lda}   
:reaction  
  
::Arrows
in the body of an Arrows email, or just the following single line input in the Web API entry box

 trichloromethanol theory{pspw} xc{lda} + methane theory{pspw} xc{lda}   
 --> chloroform theory{pspw} xc{lda} + methyl alcohol theory{pspw} xc{lda}
Entering ESMILES in this way for reactions is tedius and prone to typos. To simplify this type of input a map function has been added to the reaction input, where the format for the mapping function is to append the reaction with the tilde, "~", symbol followed by the esmiles options.

trichloromethanol + methane --> chloroform + methyl alcohol ~ theory{pspw} xc{lda}
The map function essentially appends every compound in the reaction by the esmiles options string.This is preferred way to use the map function. However, an alternative format for entering the map function has also been added to the reaction: :reaction block. The format of the block is reaction[esmiles options]: reaction :reaction.

Arrows::  
  
reaction[theory{pspw} xc{lda}]:   
trichloromethanol + methane --> chloroform + methyl alcohol    
:reaction  
  
::Arrows
How to Define the Chemical Structure with XYZ Input
The xyzinput: :xyzinput block is used to enter a chemical structure using xyz coordinates. The label: :label subblock is used to label the xyz structure so that it can be referenced in reaction: :reaction, molecule: :molecule, and nmr: :nmr blocks. The xyz geometry is entered inside the xyzdata: :xyzdata block. The coordinates are assumed to be in Angstroms. The xyz geometry can either contain the number of atoms at the start of the input, e.g.

Generate a Reaction Path
[*' Reaction Path*'](https://ebylaska.github.io/TinyArrows/reactionpath)
As illustrated in the previous section, it is quite common to hypothesize a chemical reaction network that contains multiple branching pathways that are all thermodynamically favorable. As a result of this, relying only on reaction energies can be limiting, and approaches to modeling reaction kinetics, e.g. transition-states and reaction pathways are needed. Unfortunately, these types of calculations involve difficult optimizations that can easily fail. Even in best case scenarios with an expert user running the calculation, this type of calculation will still end up being 10-20 times more expensive than a reaction energy calculation. Modeling reactions in solution is even worse. In addition, transition-states usually contain non-bonding electronic states that are not well described by lower levels of electronic structure theories, and moreover many reactions, even intrinsic one-step reactions, end up having multiple pathways containing multiple barriers. In short, these calculations are time-consuming and difficult, and not surprisingly, automating calculations for transition-states and reaction pathways is an active area of research. Even though transition-state and reaction pathway calculation are not completely automated in Arrows, there are several workflows implemented in Arrows that can be used to perform these types of simulations (see the online Arrows manuals \url{https://nwchemgit.github.io/EMSL_Arrows.html#} or \url{https://ebylaska.github.io/TinyArrows/}).

Reaction path simulations are an example of a molecular simulation that can benefit from the workflow capabilities in Arrows. As a simple example we demonstrate how to calculate the reaction path energies for the following reaction.

carbon dioxide + [HH] --> carbon monoxide + water
This is a fundamental reaction for catalysis in which methanol is formed by combining the carbon dioxide with hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst.
